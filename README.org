** BUFF_SIZE
Changing the =BUFF_SIZE= to a very big value, ex. =10000000=, make the program
SEGFAULT because the default size of the stack is only =8192000= byte (=ulimit
-Sa=) so the stack oxplodes. To use the previous =BUFF_SIZE= you can change the
size of the stack to =10000000= byte with =ulimit -s 10000=.
